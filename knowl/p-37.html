<p>A graph of \(f(x)\) around \(x=1\) and a table are given in Figures <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig_nolimit1.html" title="Figure 1.1.13">Figure 1.1.13</a> and <a data-knowl="./knowl/table_nolimit1.html" title="Figure 1.1.14">Figure 1.1.14</a>, respectively. It is clear that as \(x\) approaches \(1\text{,}\) \(f(x)\) does not seem to approach a single number. Instead, it seems as though \(f(x)\) approaches two different numbers. When considering values of \(x\) less than \(1\) (approaching \(1\) from the left), it seems that \(f(x)\) is approaching \(2\text{;}\) when considering values of \(x\) greater than \(1\) (approaching \(1\) from the right), it seems that \(f(x)\) is approaching \(1\text{.}\) Recognizing this behavior is important; we'll study this in greater depth later. Right now, it suffices to say that the limit does not exist since \(f(x)\) is approaching two <em class="emphasis">different</em> values as \(x\) approaches \(1\text{.}\)</p>
