<p>The previous example was a little long in that we sampled a few specific cases of \(\varepsilon\) before handling the general case. Normally this is not done. The previous example is also a bit unsatisfying in that \(\sqrt{4}=2\text{;}\) why work so hard to prove something so obvious? Many \(\varepsilon\)–\(\delta\) proofs are long and difficult to do. In this section, we will focus on examples where the answer is, frankly, obvious, because the non-obvious examples are even harder. In the next section we will learn some theorems that allow us to evaluate limits <em class="emphasis">analytically</em>, that is, without using the \(\varepsilon\)–\(\delta\) definition.</p>
