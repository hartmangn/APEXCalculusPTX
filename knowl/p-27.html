<p>Since tables and graphs are used only to <em class="emphasis">approximate</em> the value of a limit, there is not a firm answer to how many data points are “enough.” Include enough so that a trend is clear, and use values (when possible) both less than and greater than the value in question. In <a data-knowl="./knowl/ex_limit1.html" title="Example 1.1.6: Approximating the value of a limit">Example 1.1.6</a>, we used both values less than and greater than \(3\text{.}\) Had we used just \(x=3.001\text{,}\) we might have been tempted to conclude that the limit had a value of \(0.3\text{.}\) While this is not far off, we could do better. Using values “on both sides of 3” helps us identify trends.</p>
