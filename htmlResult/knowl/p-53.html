<li><p>As \(x\) approaches \(1\) from the left, we consider a limit where all \(x\)-values are less than \(1\text{.}\) This means we use the \(2-x\) piece of the piecewise function \(f\) as the domain for that piece is \((0,1)\text{.}\) As the \(x\)-values near \(1\text{,}\) \(2-x\) approaches \(1\text{;}\) that is, \(f(x)\) approaches \(1\text{.}\) Therefore \(\ds \lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x)=1.\) </p></li>
<li><p>As \(x\) approaches \(1\) from the right, we consider a limit where all \(x\)-values are greater than \(1\text{.}\) This means we use the \((x-2)^2\) piece of \(f\) as the domain for that piece is \((1,2)\text{.}\) As the \(x\)-values near \(1\text{,}\) \((x-2)^2\) approaches \(1\text{;}\) that is, we see that again \(f(x)\) approaches \(1\text{.}\) Therefore \(\ds \lim_{x\to 1+} f(x)=1\text{.}\) </p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">The</em> limit of \(f\) as \(x\) approaches \(1\) exists and is \(1\text{,}\) as \(f\) approaches \(1\) from both the right and left. Therefore \(\lim\limits_{x\to 1} f(x)=1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Neither piece of \(f\) is defined for the \(x\)-value of \(1\text{;}\) in other words, \(1\) is not in the domain of \(f\text{.}\) Therefore \(f(1)\) is not defined. </p></li>
<li><p>As \(x\) approaches  \(0\) from the right, we consider a limit where all \(x\)-values are greater than \(0\text{.}\) This means we use the \(2-x\) piece of \(f\text{.}\) As the \(x\)-values near \(0\text{,}\) \(2-x\) approaches \(2\text{;}\) that is, \(f(x)\) approaches \(2\text{.}\) So \(\ds \lim_{x\to 0^+} f(x)=2\text{.}\) </p></li>
<li><p>\(f(0)\) is not defined as \(0\) is not in the domain of \(f\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>As \(x\) approaches  \(2\) from the left, we consider a limit where all \(x\)-values are less than \(2\text{.}\) This means we use the \((x-2)^2\) piece of \(f\text{.}\) As the \(x\)-values near \(2\text{,}\) \((x-2)^2\) nears \(0\text{;}\) that is, \(f(x)\) approaches \(0\text{.}\) So \(\ds \lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x)=0\text{.}\) </p></li>
<li><p>\(f(2)\) is not defined as \(2\) is not in the domain of \(f\text{.}\)</p></li>
