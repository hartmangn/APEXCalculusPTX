<p>For these problems, the visual aid of the graph is likely more effective in evaluating the limits than using \(f\) itself. Therefore we will refer often to the graph.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>As \(x\) goes to \(1\) <em class="emphasis">from the left</em>, we see that \(f(x)\) is approaching the value of \(1\text{.}\) Therefore \(\lim\limits_{x\to 1^-} f(x) =1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We could of course evaluate this limit symbolically by examining the defintion of \(f\text{.}\) Since we are approaching \(1\) from the left, we would choose the first “piece” of the function, that is the one with domain \(0 \leq x \leq 1\text{.}\) So \(\lim\limits_{x\to 1^-} x =1\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>As \(x\) goes to \(1\) <em class="emphasis">from the right</em>, we see that \(f(x)\) is approaching the value of \(2\text{.}\) Recall that it does not matter that there is an “open circle” there; we are evaluating a limit, not the value of the function. Therefore \(\lim\limits_{x\to 1^+} f(x)=2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">The</em> limit of \(f\) as \(x\) approaches \(1\) does not exist, as discussed in <span>(((Unresolved xref, reference "sec_limit_intro"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute)))</span><a href="" class="internal" title="">Section </a>. The function does not approach one particular value, but two different values from the left and the right.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the definition, and by looking at the graph, we see that \(f(1) = 1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>As \(x\) goes to \(0\) from the right, we see that \(f(x)\) is approaching \(0\text{.}\) Therefore \(\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+} f(x)=0\text{.}\) Note we cannot consider a left-hand limit at \(0\) as \(f\) is not defined for values of \(x\lt 0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Using the definition and the graph, \(f(0) = 0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>As \(x\) goes to \(2\) from the left, we see that \(f(x)\) is approaching the value of \(1\text{.}\) Therefore \(\lim\limits_{x\to 2^-} f(x)=1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The graph and the definition of the function show that \(f(2)\) is not defined.</p></li>
